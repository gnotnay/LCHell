1. 每日：一位小组组员做题或者讲题（屏幕分享）
2. 每周：每人至少轮流讲题一次、做题一次
3. 题目难度：暂定 medium，以及 hard 好题
4. 讲题日：讲题者需在每日中午之前分享题号
5. 做题日：其他小组组员为做题人随机抽取题目（medium 难度）
6. 讲题时长：控制在 25 分钟以内，一题多解可适当延长
7. 做题时长：限制在 35 分钟以内，做完后 25 分钟讨论
8. 每次会议采取 zoom 直播，直播完后保存视频方便提高和回看
9. 原则上不得请假，缺席
10. 拿到 offer 需要给每个人发（在组时日\*1 元）红包，相互鼓励
11. 新组员刷题量（leetcode）不得低于现有小组组员最小值
12. 友好交流，不得言语嘲讽，消极回答
13. Happy Coding!
